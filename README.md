I am a self-taught IT enthusiast with a passion for learning and experimenting. I've been exploring the world of IT since I was 9, starting with graphic designing, animations, game development, and web development. I approach every new skill with a hands-on mindset, diving deep into the underlying concepts and mechanics of the technology. I believe in not using frameworks or libraries when learning a new language or skill as it allows me to have a better understanding of the language and avoid shortcuts. I am experienced in a variety of programming languages and have a strong understanding of best practices. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills. Let's build something great together!
